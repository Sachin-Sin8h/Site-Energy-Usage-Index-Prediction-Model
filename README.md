# Site-Energy-Usage-Index-Prediction
Predicting the Energy Usage Index value for sites using linear regression model in R programming
The model building was the part of WIDS Datathon (Kaggle) which was conducted from Jan-March 2022. The competition saw more than 800 teams participating. The objective was to create a prediction model of Site energy usage index based on other variables including avg temp., building type, year built, facility type, monthly min max temp. etc. using linear regression technique and minimize the RMSE value as a sign of more efficient model.
